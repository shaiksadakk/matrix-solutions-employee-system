# Matrix Solutions – Employee Management System

This is a simple **Employee Management System** built using **Java, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, and MySQL**.

I created this project to understand how a real Java web application works end-to-end — from database connection to UI rendering using JSP and Servlets.  
The focus of this project is **clean flow, proper structure, and real CRUD operations**, not just UI.

## Why I Built This Project

As a Java Full Stack learner, I wanted to:

- Work with **real database operations** (not dummy data)
- Understand **Servlet → DAO → DB → JSP** flow
- Learn how projects actually run on **Tomcat**
- Practice debugging real issues (ports, classpath, JDBC, JSP errors, etc.)

This project helped me connect all those dots.

## What This Application Does

- Add employee details
- View all employees in a table
- Update employee information
- Delete employee records
- Show success / error messages after operations

The UI is kept **clean and readable**, and the application follows a basic **MVC structure**.
